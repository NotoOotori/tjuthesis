	abstract = {{AC}, the axiom of choice, because of its non-constructive character, is the most controversial mathematical axiom, shunned by some, used indiscriminately by others. This treatise shows paradigmatically that: Disasters happen without {AC}: Many fundamental mathematical results fail (being equivalent in {ZF} to {AC} or to some weak form of {AC}). Disasters happen with {AC}: Many undesirable mathematical monsters are being created (e.g., non measurable sets and undeterminate games). Some beautiful mathematical theorems hold only if {AC} is replaced by some alternative axiom, contradicting {AC} (e.g., by {AD}, the axiom of determinateness). Illuminating examples are drawn from diverse areas of mathematics, particularly from general topology, but also from algebra, order theory, elementary analysis, measure theory, game theory, and graph theory.},
