	isbn = {978-3-540-30989-5},
	series = {Lecture Notes in Mathematics},
	abstract = {{AC}, the axiom of choice, because of its non-constructive character, is the most controversial mathematical axiom, shunned by some, used indiscriminately by others. This treatise shows paradigmatically that: Disasters happen without {AC}: Many fundamental mathematical results fail (being equivalent in {ZF} to {AC} or to some weak form of {AC}). Disasters happen with {AC}: Many undesirable mathematical monsters are being created (e.g., non measurable sets and undeterminate games). Some beautiful mathematical theorems hold only if {AC} is replaced by some alternative axiom, contradicting {AC} (e.g., by {AD}, the axiom of determinateness). Illuminating examples are drawn from diverse areas of mathematics, particularly from general topology, but also from algebra, order theory, elementary analysis, measure theory, game theory, and graph theory.},

	title = {Commutative Algebra: Volume {II}},
	volume = {2},
	series = {The University Series in Higher Mathematics},
	abstract = {This second volume of our treatise on commutative algebra deals largely with three basic topics, which go beyond the more or less classical material of volume I and are on the whole of a more advanced nature and a more recent vintage. These topics are: (a) valuation theory; (b) theory of polynomial and power series rings (including generalizations to graded rings and modules); (c) local algebra. Because most of these topics have either their source or their best motivation in algebraic geom­ etry, the algebro-geometric connections and applications of the purely algebraic material are constantly stressed and abundantly scattered through­ out the exposition. Thus, this volume can be used in part as an introduc­ tion to some basic concepts and the arithmetic foundations of algebraic geometry. The reader who is not immediately concerned with geometric applications may omit the algebro-geometric material in a first reading (see" Instructions to the reader," page vii), but it is only fair to say that many a reader will find it more instructive to find out immediately what is the geometric motivation behind the purely algebraic material of this volume. The first 8 sections of Chapter {VI} (including § 5bis) deal directly with properties of places, rather than with those of the valuation associated with a place. These, therefore, are properties of valuations in which the value group of the valuation is not involved.},

The author's treatment goes very directly to the basic language of Riemannian geometry and immediately presents some of its most fundamental theorems. It is elementary, assuming only a modest background from readers, making it suitable for a wide variety of students and course structures. Its selection of topics has been deemed "superb" by teachers who have used the text. A significant feature of the book is its powerful and revealing structure, beginning simply with the definition of a differentiable manifold and ending with one of the most important results in Riemannian geometry, a proof of the Sphere Theorem. The text abounds with basic definitions and theorems, examples, applications, and numerous exercises to test the student's understanding and extend knowledge and insight into the subject. Instructors and students alike will find the work to be a significant contribution to this highly applicable and stimulating subject.},

This book is the first comprehensive introduction to the theory of algebraic group schemes over fields that includes the structure theory of semisimple algebraic groups, and is written in the language of modern algebraic geometry. The first eight chapters study general algebraic group schemes over a field and culminate in a proof of the Barsotti–Chevalley theorem, realizing every algebraic group as an extension of an abelian variety by an affine group. After a review of the Tannakian philosophy, the author provides short accounts of Lie algebras and finite group schemes. The later chapters treat reductive algebraic groups over arbitrary fields, including the Borel–Chevalley structure theory. Solvable algebraic groups are studied in detail. Prerequisites have also been kept to a minimum so that the book is accessible to non-specialists in algebraic geometry.},

Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the text provides tools for understanding and attacking difficult problems in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology.
